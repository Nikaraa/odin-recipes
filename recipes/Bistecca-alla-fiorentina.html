    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <p>The Florentine steak, together with tripe, is one of the most popular Tuscan second courses. Let's find out how to make it on the grill with a master of meat, the famous butcher Dario Cecchini. There are two elements for a perfect Florentine: the meat, usually Chianina (the bovine breed of the area between Arezzo and Siena), has a special "T" shape with the bone in the middle, the fillet on one side and the sirloin on the other, with a maturation of at least 20 days. Furthermore, the Florentine steak must be 3 fingers high and the width must be proportionate. The other fundamental aspect is cooking: to obtain a succulent Florentine steak it is necessary to know how to prepare good embers, preferably with oak charcoal and holm oaks, the most suitable because they allow a high and constant temperature to be maintained. Externally it must be well cooked, but tradition has it that the inside is rare, to fully enjoy its tenderness. Once cooked, it is served with the bone standing, traditionally the piece dedicated to butchers which for many is the best part! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Florentine steak 2 kg</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Extra virgin oil</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To prepare the Florentine steak, first take the meat. It should be 3 fingers thick, include tenderloin and sirloin and have the right amount of fat. Leave it at room temperature for a few hours, it is important that it is not cold when cooking. Prepare the embers: use oak and holm oak charcoal and let it vent at the highest temperature point so that a light white veil forms, a sign that it has reached its maximum temperature. Place on the grill and let it warm up. Then place the steak vertically, sideways to the grill, so that the bone rests on the grill, in this way the meat will begin to warm up gently.</li>
        <li>Then place it in the center of the embers and cook it for 8 minutes on each side. Turning it around, the grid lines should be clearly visible. Once the cooking is finished, also on the other side, place the meat vertically again, next to the embers always on the bone side. In this way, resting the juices stabilize and the meat will be more tender. Be careful not to burn the bone too much.</li>
        <li>Trasferite la carne su un tagliere e lasciatela riposare ancora qualche minuto. Tagliate la bistecca dividendo il filetto dal controfiletto, lasciandolo in piedi.</li>
        <li>Regolate di sale, aggiungete un filo d'olio extravergine e massaggiatela con le mani. Ora potete servirla ben calda 12.</li>
    </ul>
