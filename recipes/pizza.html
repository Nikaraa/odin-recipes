    <h2 class="title" id="two">Description</h2>
    <p>Neapolitan pizza is one of the prides of Italian cuisine all over the world. Many try to replicate it, but often without great success. In order not to make any mistakes, we have invited the master pizza chef Davide Civitiello into our kitchen. Thanks to his recipe and all his advice, you will be able to make an excellent Neapolitan pizza at home too. The dough is simple to prepare: you start with water, as the Neapolitan pizza makers do, and you use the trough, just as tradition dictates. One of the biggest obstacles is definitely the drafting of the pizza. The dough must always be treated very delicately and it must never be stressed, otherwise it will tend to shrink... but don't worry if you don't succeed the first time, with a little practice you will be able to achieve the right dexterity and replicate all the steps explained by the master, to obtain a thin pizza with a high and honeycombed crust. Another obstacle to overcome is certainly cooking: Neapolitan pizza usually cooks for a very short time at very high temperatures, which cannot be reached with a common home oven. To overcome this problem, we added sugar and oil to the dough, which are usually not present in the original recipe; in this way the dough will be more colorful and softer. Another thing we advise not to give up is the use of refractory stone which will allow greater growth and more uniform cooking. Even the ingredients chosen for the dressing are very important, today we show you how to prepare oneperfect margherita pizza , then you can have fun customizing it with the ingredients you love most!</p>

    <ol>
        <div>
            <li>To prepare the Neapolitan pizza, first of all equip yourself with a cupboard. Pour water inside, add salt and sugar. </li>
            <li>Stir to dissolve them completely, then pour more than half of the flour5. Place the yeast in one hand6and flour the other.</li>
            <li>Crumble the yeast onto the mound of flour by rubbing it between the palms of your hands. Start mixing with one hand so that the flour gradually absorbs all the water. </li>
            <li>Add another part of the flour and always knead with one hand. Continue in this way until the flour is finished, or in any case according to the consistency of the mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour all the oil and keep kneading always with one hand until completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to the work surface and knead with two hands for about 20-25 minutes. If necessary, just a dusting of flour can be added to the counter. The dough should be smooth and not sticky. Form a balland cover it with the cupboard. Let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the resting time the dough will have relaxed, so knead it again lightly. Pirlatelo and place it in the cupboard. Cover with the appropriate lid and let it rest for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>After this time, pick up the dough again and proceed to the stall. To make the professional shape, divide the dough into two parts and take one, then form a loaf and start rounding the initial part with your left hand24.</li>
            <li>Now squeeze the loaf between thumb and forefinger to form a ball and break it at the same time, then round it on the work surface with the other hand. The easiest way to cut the dough at home is to divide the dough into pieces of equal weight: with loaves of about 250-260 g each you will get pizzas with a diameter of 28-32 cm.</li>
            <li>Rotate each portion of dough on a plane to seal the base well and obtain a spherical shape. Transfer the balls to the cupboard, spacing them well. Cover with the appropriate lid30and let them rise at a temperature of 18°-24° for 8-12 hours.</li>
            <li>Pour the peeled tomatoes into a bowl and mash them by hand. Season with salt, a drizzle of oil and the basil chopped by hand. </li>
            <li>Now move on to the fiordilatte mozzarella. Cut it in half and then sliced. Finally, make sticks that are not too thick, but not too thin either.</li>
            <li>When the panielli have almost reached leavening start taking care of the oven. Place a refractory stone inside and heat it at maximum power 30-40 minutes beforehand or even 1 hour if your oven is not very powerful. Quickly pass the first paniello in the flour on both sides. To spread the paniello you have to join your hands overlapping the indexes and thumbs so as to create a sort of triangle. Apply light pressure starting from the center and going towards the edges, pushing the dough from top to bottom so as to send the air towards the edge and create the ledge. Press the dough in this way 3 times.</li>
            <li>Try not to manipulate the dough too much and not to widen it abruptly by pulling one of the flaps, otherwise it could shrink. Now pinch the opposite edges with the index and middle fingers, as if they were scissors, and gently move the dough on the counter without pulling it. Finally put a hand in the center to hold the dough in place while gently pulling one of the edges by pinching it with the index and middle fingers, again as if they were scissors. Gently pull to widen it, then flip it onto your other hand and slam it back onto the surface, twisting it slightly. You won't have to roll out the dough completely, just roll it out halfway: in this way you won't risk breaking it once you put the sauce on. Sprinkle well with the peeled tomatoes, distributing them in a spiral motion. Leave the edge free, but make sure you cover the middle well.</li>
            <li>Then add the fiordilatte mozzarella, without exaggerating with the quantities and the grated Parmesan. Complete with fresh basil broken up by hand and a drizzle of oil.</li>
            <li>Lift the pizza and transfer it from the counter to the peel, then spread it gently with your hands. Transfer to the oven at maximum temperature, placing it directly on the previously heated refractory stone: cook for 5-7 minutes. Baked50and immediately serve your Neapolitan pizza!</li>
